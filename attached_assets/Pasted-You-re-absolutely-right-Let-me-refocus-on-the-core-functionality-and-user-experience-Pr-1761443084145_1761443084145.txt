You're absolutely right. Let me refocus on the core functionality and user experience:

## **Project Brief: Daily Template Note-Taking App**

### **What It Does**
A note-taking app that auto-generates daily notes from a customizable template, extending 7 days into the future, with Google Calendar integration and exceptional list-editing experience.

### **Core Functionality**

#### **1. Daily Note Generation**
- Automatically create notes for today + next 7 days using the template
- Each note header: `[Day] MM/DD ([Custom focus text])`
- Default template structure:
  ```
  - Preworkout
      - Text Mom
      - Talk to Alyssa
      - Work
  - Workout Post Workout
  - Schedule
  - Priority To Do
  - Secondary
  ```

#### **2. Template Management**
- User can edit the template (modify sections, bullet points, structure)
- Template changes apply ONLY to future dates
- Already-created content in existing notes remains untouched
- Template is separate from note instances

#### **3. Google Calendar Integration**
- Pull events from user's Google Calendar
- Automatically populate the "Schedule" section with that day's events
- Keep schedule updated with calendar changes

#### **4. List Editing (Critical Priority)**
**Must feel as good or better than Apple Notes for:**
- Creating new bullets (Enter key)
- Creating sub-bullets (Tab to indent)
- Moving bullets back (Shift+Tab to outdent)
- Deleting empty bullets (Backspace)
- Reordering bullets (drag and drop)
- Typing with zero lag
- Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile

### **Key Behaviors**
- Auto-save everything as user types
- Navigate between days easily
- Performance: interactions feel instant (no noticeable lag)
- Mobile-friendly: touch interactions feel natural

### **What Success Looks Like**
- I can type and manage lists as fast as in Apple Notes
- My template updates don't destroy existing content
- Calendar events appear automatically where expected
- I can plan across multiple days effortlessly

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. Should calendar events be editable once imported?
2. Check-off functionality for completed items?
3. Access to past days, or only current + 7 forward?
4. Dark mode preference?
5. Need sync across devices?
